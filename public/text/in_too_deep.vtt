00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The faster we're falling,
We're stopping and stalling
We're running in circles again

2
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Just as things we're looking up
You said it wasn't good enough
But still we're trying one more time

3
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Maybe we're just trying to hard
When really it's closer than it is too far

4
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Cause I'm in too deep, and I'm trying to keep
Up above in my head, instead of going under

5
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Cause I'm in too deep, and I'm trying to keep
Up above in my head, instead of going under x2

6
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Seems like each time
I'm with you I loose my mind
Because I'm bending over backwards to relate

7
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.000
It's one thing to complain
But when you're driving me insane
Well then I think it's time that we took a break

8
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Maybe we're just trying to hard
When really it's closer than it is too far

9
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Cause I'm in too deep, and I'm trying to keep
Up above in my head, instead of going under

10
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Cause I'm in too deep, and I'm trying to keep
Up above in my head, instead of going under x4

11
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I can't sit back and wonder why
It took so long for this to die

12
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.000
And I hate it when you fake it
You can't hide it you might as well embrace it

13
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:29.000
So believe me it's not easy
It seems that something's telling me

14
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Cause I'm in too deep, and I'm trying to keep
Up above in my head, instead of going under

15
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Cause I'm in too deep, and I'm trying to keep
Up above in my head, instead of going under

16
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Cause I'm in too deep, and I'm trying to keep
Up above in my head, instead of going under x2

17
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Instead of going under again
Instead of going under

18
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Instead of going under again x3
