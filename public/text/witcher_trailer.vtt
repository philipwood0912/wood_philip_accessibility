00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.580
I've heard tales of your kind Witcher.

2
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.590
Created by magic.

3
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:17.950
Roaming the continent.

4
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.360
We don't want your kind here. Hunting monsters

5
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.600
For a price.

6
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.110
I thought you'd have fangs or horns or something.

7
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:31.870
I had them filed down.

8
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.800
People call you a monster too.

9
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.390
Why not kill them

10
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.010
Because then I am what they say I am.

11
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.590
All of our choices draw our destinies closer.

12
00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.660
Don't Judge Me. They say witchers can't feel human emotion.

13
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.660
What do you believe in.

14
00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.010
Evil is Evil, lesser, greater.

15
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:26.760
It's all the same.

16
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.140
If you dismiss her, you will unleash true calamity upon us all.

17
00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.040
I'll take that chance.
